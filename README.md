## Overview
This is a deep learning model which helps to read medical abstract easier.


## Motivation
What to do when you are at collage and having a strong base of mathematics and keen intrest in learning ML ,DL and AI? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all unsupervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.
